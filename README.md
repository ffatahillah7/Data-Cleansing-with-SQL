## Goals of the Project:

1.  Remove Unnecessary value.
2.  Remove Duplicate value using SQL.
3.  Change or Replace with special character, space, null value into high quality data.
4.  Create column for any data needed like categorical, formula, and so on.

## Outline

1.  Materials and methods
2.  General Part : Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning

### Materials and Methods

### How To Learn with Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

1.    Business Understanding : The Business Understanding phase focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project. In this project, we should know about what's happening, why it's happening and who is involved in the dataset.

2.    Data Understanding : Next is the Data Understanding phase. Adding to the foundation of Business Understanding, it drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals. The data is consist of Name of full name, age, salary, and so on.

3.    Data Preparation : This phase, which is often referred to as “data munging”, prepares the final data set(s) for modeling. In this methods , we cleaning the data from anomali, null, not correlation data and any others missed from the data source.


### Start Working

Change the data according to its value
Change data type from text to int at phone_no column , change text to date at join_date column, and so on.
show the unique value from each columns for better understanding the data.
Remove and Replace Space
Remove Null Value
Update inconsistency data from lower to upper.
Combine any columns to one column
Remove Special characters from Phone Number column
Extract Year from Join Date Column
convert age column to spesific categorical, Junior, Middle, Senior for instance.
Remove Duplicate with using queryand compare with unique or primary key value
Split Full Name to first and last name.
